    <h1>REDHAWK Release Notes - 2.1.2</h1>
    
    
    
    

<p>The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.2 focused on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core REDHAWK Features and APIs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model and BulkIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available at <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/2.1.2/docs/shared-address">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/2.1.2/docs/shared-address</a>. This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements to REDHAWK.</li>
<li>Implementing a new zero-copy IPC mechanism for BulkIO that uses shared memory to transfer data between two processes on the same host. This is a follow-on enhancement to the shared address space Components feature. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available at <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/2.1.2/docs/shared-memory/shared-memory-ipc.md">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/2.1.2/docs/shared-memory/shared-memory-ipc.md</a>.</li>
<li>FrontEnd Interfaces (FEI) Property definition change: For Devices, the <code>FRONTEND::tuner_allocation</code> <code>FRONTEND::listener_allocation</code> allocation properties are now writeonly instead of readwrite. Because the properties are now created as writeonly, they can no longer be queried. This change was made to prevent confusion with the actual state of the FrontEnd Device, which is reported by the <code>FRONTEND::tuner status</code> property. Existing Core Asset FEI Devices have been updated with this change. New FrontEnd Devices created with the IDE will automatically have this change.</li>
<li>Adding support for a new type of Property, utctime, extending the list that includes types such as short or string. This timestamp Property is used in PropertyChangeEvents and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id <code>QUERY_TIMESTAMP</code>, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system. utctime can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional type of Property.</li>
<li>Adding functionality for capacity to be reserved for an entire host collocation on the SAD file. The reservation is a capacity floor for the Components in the host collocation, where the amount of capacity utilized by the aggregate set of Components is this reservation or actual, whichever is higher. This reservation is allocated against the target GPP running this Application, allowing the GPP to verify that the request can be satisfied, reducing the likelihood of over-subscription.</li>
<li>Adding support for DCD files to have a startorder attribute, which functions similarly to the SAD file’s startorder. On startup, “start” is automatically called on Devices and Services (when possible), and on shutdown, reverse-order “stop” is called. The IDE’s tooling for DCD files has been updated to display and edit startorder.</li>
<li>Adding support for the DeviceManager to resolve run time environment settings when deploying Devices and Services that have soft package dependencies.</li>
<li>Resolving issue so that during Application release, calls to the Application object no longer result in misleading errors.</li>
<li>Adding functionality within the code generators so they create C++, Java, or Python constants for enumerated values defined in the PRF.</li>
<li>Improving flexibility to ignore GPP threshold checks when determining if the GPP should go into a BUSY state.</li>
<li>Removing some obsolete options from the Core Framework and BulkIO configure scripts.</li>
<li>Resolving issue where processes with spaces in the names would cause the GPP to terminate.</li>
<li>Resolving issue to allow for slow startup conditions of OmniNames service before starting OmniEvents service.</li>
<li>Adding the stop timeout control to the Application. Options, like the stop timeout, can be configured when designing Waveforms in the IDE.</li>
<li>Resolving issue with incorrect exception being thrown during allocateCapacity.</li>
<li>Resolving issue when shutting down orb from Python resources.</li>
<li>Providing a warning in the logs if a message is too large.</li>
<li>Resolving issue with the code generators so they can be run on systems with FIPS enabled.</li>
<li>Resolving issue so generated C++ FEI Devices do not leak memory when deallocating listeners. Existing Devices must be regenerated and recompiled to apply this fix.</li>
<li>Resolving a memory leak in FrontendTunerDevice::create(). Existing Devices must be recompiled to apply this fix.</li>
<li>Resolving issue so the function <code>returnRFInfoPkt</code> transforms all fields between types <code>frontend::RFInfoPkt</code> and <code>FRONTEND::RFInfoPkt</code>.</li>
<li>Adjusting the default tuner type for the Python Sandbox tuner allocation. It is now <code>RX_DIGITIZER</code> rather than DDC, matching the default tuner for a generated FEI Device.</li>
<li>Preventing sb.DataSink from adding an empty timestamp when it receives EOS in an empty packet.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>REDHAWK Systems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adding scripts and configuration files that allow REDHAWK core services to run as system services. In addition to these services, integrators can define REDHAWK Waveforms that are deployed during the system boot process.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Python Tooling and Sandbox</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adding snapshot capability of network data and performing SDDS packet analysis on the captured data.</li>
<li>Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example, these improvements include more intuitive event monitoring as well as new EventChannelManager, AllocationManager, and ConnectionManager helpers.</li>
<li>Adding support for debugger options in the Python sandbox for C++ (Valgrind or gdb), Python (pdb), or Java (jdb) Components, Services, or Devices.</li>
<li>Improving Python Sandbox tooling for new Domain features and resources. Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the data timestamp.</li>
<li>Adding an option to enable the Domain Manager’s logging level to be dynamically changed.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>GPP</strong></p>

<ul>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p>The following IDE and Core Framework new features were added in REDHAWK 2.1.2.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Python Sandbox DataSink object supports a stream API, allowing the DataSink to handle multiple incoming streams and variable SRI.</li>
<li>The startorder attribute was added to the componentinstantiation element of DCD (node) files. When startorder is set, the Device or Service (if it supports the CF::Resource interface), will receive a start call on the Device Manager startup and a stop call on the Device Manager shutdown.</li>
<li>Adding functionality in the Sandbox so when using “connect” on a REDHAWK object in a Python session, if the object is an FEI Device and it has a tuner allocated, a listener is automatically created and connected to that tuner.</li>
<li>The “metrics” function on the Application object accepts two string sequences (components and attributes), and returns the current utilization by all Components of GPP resources. An aggregate consumption amount is also returned.</li>
<li>Added ability to configure the timeout value for calls to an Application’s Components when the Application-level stop function is invoked.</li>
<li>Added an editor for SCD files.</li>
<li>Services can now be added when creating a Node project.</li>
<li>Added a Details section for the Service selected in the Devices/Services tab of the Node editor.</li>
<li>Added support to add Services to existing projects in the Node editor.</li>
<li>Added startorder to DCD XML model.</li>
<li>Added the ability to add well-known REDHAWK Properties when editing Properties.</li>
<li>Added the ability to connect to a Domain Manager by selecting from a list.</li>
<li>Added startorder support to the DCD diagram editor.</li>
<li>Adding editor support to adjust GPP reservations for hostcollocations in a Waveform.</li>
<li>Updated the CF.DomainManager IDL to include CF.Logging.</li>
<li>Added the ability to view Waveform metrics in the Properties view.</li>
<li>Added options to the SAD XML model.</li>
<li>Providing the ability to edit SAD file options.</li>
</ul>
