    <h1>REDHAWK Release Notes - 2.1.1</h1>
    
    
    
    

<h2 id="core-redhawk-features-and-apis">Core REDHAWK Features and APIs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model and BulkIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address">here</a>.

<ul>
<li>This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements to REDHAWK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adding the API for a new type of tuner, a scanning Device.</li>
<li>Adding support for a new type of Property, utctime, extending the list that includes types such as short or string. This timestamp Property is used in Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id <code>QUERY_TIMESTAMP</code>, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system. The new type of Property can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional type of Property.</li>
<li>Adding functionality for capacity to be reserved for an entire host collocation on the SAD file. The reservation is a capacity floor for the Components in the host collocation, where the amount of capacity utilized by the aggregate set of Components is this reservation or actual, whichever is higher. This reservation is allocated against the target GPP running this Application, allowing the GPP to verify that the request can be satisfied, reducing the likelihood of over-subscription.</li>
<li>Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency to now be launched on the same host (Device Manager/Node) as the Device satisfying the usesdevice requirement. This functionality is provided through an extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.</li>
<li>Extending DeviceManager to call <code>configure()</code> on Services at the time they register. This enables users to implement custom Property handling if so desired.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="redhawk-systems">REDHAWK Systems</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changing the default logging directory for omniEvents service to reside in <code>/var/log/omniEvents</code>.</li>
<li>Improving <code>nodeBooter</code> so it does not deploy if <code>--user</code> or <code>--group</code> are set while <code>--daemon</code> is not, and if the command-line arguments to <code>nodeBooter</code> are malformed, deployment fails.</li>
<li>Adding support for the state of the Connection Manager and Event Channel Manager to be restored when persistence is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-code-generation">Project Code Generation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixing code generators for Port generation of C++ Components to correctly handle data structures returned from methods.</li>
<li>Providing functionality to add custom headers to project files when generating code.</li>
<li>Providing Generate Waveform and Generate Node buttons in the IDE editors to initiate file generation. This ensures that Waveform and Node project spec files are created or modified only when requested by the user.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="python-tooling-and-sandbox">Python Tooling and Sandbox</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adding snapshot capability of network data and performing SDDS packet analysis on the captured data.</li>
<li>Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example, these improvements include eventChannelManager, allocationManager, and connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.</li>
<li>Improving Python Sandbox tooling for new Domain features and resources. Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the data timestamp.</li>
<li>Adding an option to enable the Domain Manager’s logging level to be dynamically changed.</li>
<li>Correcting issue in the Python Sandbox so now when the BulkIO queue is full, the Python Sandbox no longer locks up when trying to release stopped Components.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gpp">GPP</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improving flexibility to ignore GPP threshold checks when determining if the GPP should go into a BUSY state.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ide">IDE</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updating the IDE to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Oxygen.</li>
<li>Providing the <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/tm-terminal">TM Terminal</a> in the IDE, a full-featured terminal emulator that provides full ANSI cursor control, readline, and coloring.</li>
<li>Adding the Components tab to the Waveform editor in the IDE to allow editing of Component instantiation details, including logging configuration. This information will be used to resolve the <code>LOGGING_CONFIG_URI</code>parameter during Component deployment.</li>
<li>Showing IDL details when Ports are selected in the REDHAWK Explorer view.</li>
<li>Providing validation of Property references in SAD and DCD files and flagging invalid Property references as errors.</li>
<li>Adding the ability to terminate services in the Sandbox via the hover pad or the delete key and making the terminate icon more distinct throughout the IDE.</li>
<li>Providing an option in the IDE to perform a FrontEnd Device allocation in the background to aid developers who are debugging their FrontEnd Devices.</li>
<li>Improving the IDE’s Domain refresh logic to prevent the IDE from consuming excessive numbers of threads in some scenarios.</li>
<li>Correcting the parsing of some numeric literals in Octave M files.</li>
<li>Fixing links in the IDE’s help contents so REDHAWK help now displays correctly when links within the help are selected.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adding documentation for developing a logging configuration plug-in that will be used to resolve <code>LOGGING_CONFIG_URI</code> parameter during deployment of Devices, Services and Components.</li>
<li>Renaming the Generating Code section to Generating Code for Components and explaining the code generation process and what occurs in the IDE when the code is generated.</li>
<li>Revising the BulkIO High-speed data code example in User Manual.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="redhawk-enterprise-integration">REDHAWK Enterprise Integration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updating REDHAWK Java Driver and REDHAWK REST to make it easier for users to access External Properties in Waveforms.</li>
<li>Adding implementations of ConnectionManager, AllocationManager interfaces to REDHAWK Driver. Adding utility methods for programatically setting the log level of Domain, Application, Device, and Component Resources.</li>
<li>Adding REST access to Event Channel Manager functionality.</li>
<li>Resolving issue when activating local servants for MessageConsumerPort and MessageSupplierPort Java classes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p>The following IDE and Core Framework new features were added in REDHAWK 2.1.1.</p>

<ul>
<li>C++ shared address space Components can be launched in debug mode.</li>
<li>The <code>configure()</code> method is called when launching Services that support it.</li>
<li>Added an icon and the refid of the Uses Device for host collocations with an associated Uses Device reference.</li>
<li>The IDE is now built on Eclipse Oxygen, the latest version of Eclipse.</li>
<li>When creating a Service project that makes use of the PropertySet IDL interface (either directly or via inheritance), a PRF file is generated.</li>
<li>A link is now available in the SPD, SAD and DCD editors to add a header to the project’s files.</li>
<li>An optional user-supplied header can now be added to files during the code generation process.</li>
<li>A command-line terminal (&ldquo;TM Terminal&rdquo;) is now available in the IDE and can be opened via Ctrl+Alt+T.</li>
<li>Added a Components tab to the SAD editor for editing Component instantiation details.</li>

<li>Components launched in the Python Sandbox have an ID with the pattern similar to the ID when launched in a Waveform (for example, &ldquo;instance_id:waveform_id&rdquo;).</li>
<li>The Python Sandbox function api() uses a pager to display Properties/Ports.</li>
<li>The Python Sandbox DataSink object supports a stream API, allowing the DataSink to handle multiple incoming streams and variable SRI.</li>
<li>Input Python Sandbox elements (for example, DataSink) can be customized with user-defined sinks.</li>
<li>The <code>sb.SRIKeyword</code> function can now support sequence values for keywords as well as simple values.</li>

<li>The valid initialization string for utctime properties has been expanded from <code>YYYY:MM:DD::HH:MM:SS.S</code> to include <code>now</code> as a valid value.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>loggingconfig</code> element contents when deploying a Component in a Waveform.</li>
<li>Capacity reservations can now be added to host collocations, and reservations are checked with the GPP before deployment to avoid oversubscription.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>

<p>The following Core Framework and IDE improvements were completed in REDHAWK 2.1.1.</p>

<h3 id="core-framework-improvements">Core Framework Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Python Sandbox <code>MessageSink</code> includes a <code>getMessages</code> function. When <code>storeMessages</code> is set to True in the <code>MessageSink</code> constructor, <code>getMessages</code> can be used to retrieve the received messages even if a callback is not provided.</li>
<li>Added support for a Java debugger (jdb) in the Python Sandbox when launching Components.</li>
<li>A throttle option for <code>DataSource</code> and <code>FileSource</code> was added for data to be generated at the given sample rate.</li>
<li>The Octave libraries are now located with the octave-config utility, which reduces the time taken to find them.</li>
<li>Added tests to verify that the connection manager state is persisted when persistence is enabled.</li>
<li>Added support for the state of the Event Channel Manager to be restored when persistence is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ide-improvements">IDE Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improved the REDHAWK Explorer view to include an IDL section in the Properties view for selected Ports.</li>
<li>RPM spec files for Waveforms and Nodes are now generated manually.</li>
<li>The IDE now performs validation on the Properties assigned to Component/Devices in SAD/DCD files and reports an error if a Property does not exist in the Component/Device’s PRF file.</li>
<li>Added a red trash can icon in the Device Manager Sandbox service button pad that terminates services running in the Device Manager Sandbox.</li>
<li>Added functionality so delete hotkey now terminates a running Service in the IDE Sandbox.</li>
<li>Added validation for the refid attribute of a usesdeviceref in a SAD file.</li>
<li>Added functionality to enable FEI allocation to run in a background thread.</li>
<li>Modified the icon for terminate so it is now distinct from the icon for stop.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<p>The following Core Framework, IDE, and documentation fixes were completed in REDHAWK 2.1.1.</p>

<h3 id="core-framework-fixes">Core Framework Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>RH::DEPLOYMENT_ROOT for deployed Components is the cache directory, not the working directory.</li>
<li>Generated code for FEI Python Devices produces a properly-formed exception when the sample rate, center frequency, or bandwidth requested on the digital tuner control Port is less than 0.</li>
<li>Added the function addChannels to the FEI base classes. This function enables the developer to add combinations of tuner types in the same Device. The function setNumChannels is still supported, but its functionality has been replaced by addChannels.</li>
<li>Device Manager nodeBooter process no longer prints an error to stdout when a Service is included in the Node.</li>
