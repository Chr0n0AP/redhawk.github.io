    <h1>REDHAWK Release Notes - 2.1.3</h1>
    
    
    
    

<p>The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.3 focused on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding snapshot capability of network data and performing SDDS packet analysis on the captured data.</li>
<li>Adding scripts and configuration files that allow REDHAWK core services to run as system services.  In addition to these services, integrators can define REDHAWK waveforms that are deployed during the system boot process.</li>
<li>Extending the tool, <code>rh_net_diag</code>, to provide read/write/execute permissions checks on directories important for running a REDHAWK system.</li>
<li>Creating a new MSDD device released with bug fixes and enhancements and regenerated for REDHAWK 2.1.</li>
<li>Changing the default logging directory for omniEvents service to reside in <code>/var/log/omniEvents</code>.</li>
<li>FrontEnd Interfaces (FEI) property definition change: For devices, the <code>FRONTEND::tuner_allocation</code> and <code>FRONTEND::listener_allocation</code> allocation properties are now writeonly instead of readwrite. Because the properties are now created as writeonly, they can no longer be queried. This change was made to prevent confusion with the actual state of the FrontEnd device, which is reported by the <code>FRONTEND::tuner_status property</code>. Existing Core Asset FEI devices have been updated with this change. New FrontEnd devices created with the IDE will automatically have this change.</li>
<li>Adding functionality to the IDE so when users edit a property&rsquo;s name, the IDE automatically supplies an appropriate ID for the property based on REDHAWK&rsquo;s naming convention.</li>
<li>Adding documentation to the REDHAWK Manual regarding naming elements in structures such that element names can be reused across different structures.</li>
<li>Updating FEI unit tests.</li>
<li>Updating the <code>rh.VITA49</code> REDHAWK shared library to include support for VITA 49.2. Initial release adheres to the draft specification, revision 00.51 dated 5 Dec 2016, which was available during development.</li>
<li>Adding functionality in the IDE to install the diagram layout when installing a SAD/DCD file (either by drag-drop or via its RPM <code>.spec</code> file). At runtime, the IDE checks for the diagram layout and if present, preserves the developer&rsquo;s layout.</li>
<li>Adding an option to enable the Domain Manager&rsquo;s logging level to be dynamically changed.</li>
<li>Adding a new packed bit data port type and data format for BulkIO:

<ul>
<li>Port API for component developers is fully implemented in C++, Python, and Java.</li>
<li>Plotting, monitoring, and data interaction are supported in the IDE and Python Sandbox.</li>
<li>For C++ and Python, a new <code>bitbuffer</code> class provides high-level access to packed bit data.</li>
<li>In Python, all BulkIO ports now support a stream-based API that is consistent with C++.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adding CF base class support and IDE tooling to allow users to create, implement and test a FrontEnd scanner device.</li>
<li>Adding extensible hierarchical name structure support for loggers.</li>
<li>Correcting behavior for structures that have a default value that is mixed simple values and sequences; if the sequence is empty, it is not treated as nil.</li>
<li>Adding support for working with multi-out ports.</li>
<li>Adding Allocation Manager functionality in the IDE:  Current allocations and allocation details for each allocation can be viewed, devices used for an allocation and Device Managers referenced by an allocation can be searched for, and allocations can be deallocated.</li>
<li>In the REDHAWK IDE, adding context-sensitive property views for the following:

<ul>
<li>Waveform and node properties are displayed when selecting the respective runtime editor.  Runtime connection details are also displayed (read-only) when selecting a connection in a diagram editor.</li>
<li><code>SoftwareAssembly</code> and <code>DeviceConfiguration</code> properties are displayed when selecting the respective design-time editor. Design-time connection properties are displayed when selecting a connection in a diagram editor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Providing better context-specific icons throughout the IDE.</li>
<li>Providing new functionality for interacting with event channels and message event ports.</li>
<li>Adding Connection Manager functionality in the IDE: Current connections and connection details for each connection can be viewed, the source or target of a connection can be searched for, and connections can be disconnected.</li>
<li>Resolving issue so when launching waveforms containing references to mistyped properties, the IDE displays all the properties including the property that had a mis-matched override in the SAD file.</li>
<li>Adding validation for mistyped property refs.</li>
<li>Fixing improperly scoped locks in Core Framework control.</li>
<li>Implementing several C++ fixes to allow REDHAWK to compile on newer compilers.</li>
<li>Correcting default property kinds in the DTD and XSD so they are no longer out of sync with the behavior of the Core Framework and the ICD.</li>
<li>Adding new behavior to the C++ input stream API: It is now possible to &ldquo;peek&rdquo; into data sets that have reached EOS by setting consume to 0 when using read or tryread.</li>
<li>Adding support to custom IDL and FEI control ports so they now accept a connection id argument to specify the connection to use and throw exceptions if the port call is exercised and no connection exists or a connection is specified that does not exist.</li>
<li>Resolving issue so when unhandled exceptions occur in Python and Java components, the components terminate rather than remain in a defunct state. If termination was not requested, the GPP now sends a message to the IDM channel when a component exits with a non-zero status.</li>
<li>Updating the FEI specification to require a device to only partially support a requested signal range rather than the whole signal to return a valid request. The <code>validateRequest</code> function in the <code>frontendInterfaces</code> support package checks that a partial overlap of the requested band succeeds rather than requiring full coverage of the requested range.</li>
<li>Patching omniORBpy to prevent possible segfaults in multithreaded code.</li>
<li>Updating SourceSDDS to include use of shared memory API.</li>
<li>Updating the IDE on CentOS 7 to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Photon.</li>
<li>Correcting behavior so readonly property kind properties for Devices and Services can now be modified during deployment using Device Configuration Descriptor (dcd.xml) file.</li>
<li>Correcting an issue where a bad XML file in the SDRROOT caused loading of the SDRROOT to stop and report an error.</li>
<li>Updating <code>rh.VITA49</code> to adhere to approved version of V49.2 Standard (August 2017).</li>
<li>Adding an option for <code>MessageSupplierPort</code> to send messages to a specific connection.</li>
<li>Deprecating REDHAWK Enterprise Integration and removing all references to it within the documentation.</li>
<li>Providing the ability to generate configuration files for waveforms and nodes for use by the REDHAWK admin service.</li>
<li>Changing the <code>redhawk</code> user&rsquo;s home directory. When installing REDHAWK, the home directory is now <code>/var/redhawk</code>. When upgrading, the existing <code>redhawk</code> user home directory is updated to <code>/var/redhawk</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-resolution">Special Resolution</h3>

<p>The following previously reported Known Issues have been closed in REDHAWK 2.1.3 with the following resolutions:</p>

<h4 id="core-framework-special-resolutions">Core Framework Special Resolutions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sandbox DataSource.push() slow - Won&rsquo;t Fix - In REDHAWK 2.1.3, the new <code>StreamSource</code> sandbox helper provides better performance than the legacy <code>DataSource</code> helper when pushing real sample data. <code>DataSource.push()</code> will not be updated in the 2.0.x series to address this performance concern.</li>
<li>Struct_from_props fails during allocate_capacity in python device - Won&rsquo;t Fix - This behavior is not an error.</li>
<li><code>log_level</code> api does not appear to work for C++ components - Duplicate of and fixed by CF-1894, Add hierarchical logging support in C++, as the <code>log_level</code> attribute for component interfaces is now tied to <code>_baseLog</code> and the resource logger.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ide-special-resolutions">IDE Special Resolutions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Generate button temporarily disabled on SPD editor - Cannot Reproduce</li>
<li>Uses FEI Device wizard overwrites existing allocation ID - Duplicate of  IDE-2177, FEI uses device wizard doesn&rsquo;t preserve existing XML values.</li>
<li>SAD editor properties tab allows setting external IDs on struct / struct seq members - Cannot Reproduce</li>
</ul>
