_The REDHAWK Program Office commits to support each Long Term Support (LTS) baseline of the REDHAWK product for four years.  An LTS baseline of REDHAWK is defined as:  a feature complete series, sub-minor version releases consist of bug fixes only, and both API and ABI forwards/backwards compatibility is guaranteed between sub-minor releases.  Long Term Support (LTS) for the REDHAWK 2.2.x releases will continue through August 2022._
