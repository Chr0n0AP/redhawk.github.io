title: "Device Manager Service Configuration File"
weight: 40
---

The REDHAWK Device Manager service is controlled by files in the `/etc/redhawk/nodes.d` directory. Default configuration parameters are stored in `/etc/redhawk/init.d/node.defaults`. Although there are no rules on partitioning nodes for a REDHAWK system, it is recommended that you do not define more than one GPP per computing host. To define multiple nodes for a computing host, create a new configuration file for each Node.

The Device Manager can be configured to start after the Domain Manager has started up, or it can start up at the same time as the Domain Manager, and it will wait for the domain to be available and register its [Devices]({{< relref "manual/devices">}}) and [Services]({{< relref "manual/services">}}). If many devices or services need to start, it is recommended that you add a custom script to verify that the Device Manager has started all devices and services and registered them with the Domain Manager (see the `start_post_script` parameter).

[rhadmin]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/rhadmin.md" >}}) can generate an example Device Manager configuration file with the complete set of parameters that can be used to the control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK Device Manager service. To generate a generic Device Manager configuration, enter the following command.
```sh
rhadmin config node > node.ini
```
To generate a node configuration from an existing Device Manager project, enter the following command.
```sh
rhadmin config node <path/to/node>/DeviceManager.dmd.xml <optional DomainName> > node.ini
```
