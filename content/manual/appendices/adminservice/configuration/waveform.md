title: "Waveform Configuration File"
weight: 50
---

REDHAWK waveforms are controlled by files in the `/etc/redhawk/waveforms.d` directory. The AdminService provides the initial values for the configuration parameters of a service. Any values in the `/etc/redhawk/init.d/waveform.defaults` file override the initial configuration. Finally, the values in the INI file override any configuration (defined internally or specified in the `/etc/redhawk/init.d/waveform.defaults` file). To define multiple waveform instances in one file, add multiple sections.

The waveform can be configured to start after the Device Manager has started up; it can also optionally wait a configurable amount of time for the domain to be available before attempting to start an instance of the waveform. If the waveform depends on devices or services, it is recommended that you add a custom script to verify that those devices and services have started and registered with the Domain Manager (refer to the `start_pre_script` parameter).

[rhadmin]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/rhadmin.md" >}}) can generate an example waveform configuration file with the complete set of parameters that can be used to the control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK waveform. To generate a generic waveform configuration, enter the following command.
```sh
cd /etc/redhawk/waveforms.d
rhadmin config waveform > waveform.ini
```
To generate a waveform configuration from an existing waveform project, enter the following command.
```sh
cd /etc/redhawk/waveforms.d
rhadmin config waveform <path/to/waveform>/<file>.sad.xml <DomainName> > waveform.ini
```

required: Yes  
default value: None  
format: Valid directory under `$SDRROOT/dom/waveforms`, or a namespaced waveform identifier (for example, `rh.MyWaveform`)

parameter: `INSTANCE_NAME`  
required: No  
format: A name with no spaces or periods (for example, `THE_WAVEFORM`)  
description: Specifies an instance-specific name for the waveform.

parameter: `OSSIEHOME`  
required: No  
default: `$OSSIEHOME`  
format: Standard shell path environment variable  
description: The absolute path to use as the `OSSIEHOME` for this waveform.

parameter: `PYTHONPATH`  
required: No  
default value: `$PYTHONPATH`  
format: Standard shell path environment variable  
description: The path used by Python interpreter to load modules; overridesthe  `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

parameter: `start_delay`  
required: No  
default value: `30`  
description: The amount of time for the waveform control script to wait for the Domainmanager to be available before failing startup.

parameter: `enable`  
required: No  
default value: `True`  
format: `True`, `False`, or a string to be matched against `conditional_config`  
description: Specifies if waveform may be started. `True` or `False` will enable or disable the waveform. Refer to `conditional_config` for information about how a string value gets evaluated.

parameter: `conditional_config`  
required: No  
default value: `/etc/redhawk/rh.cond.cfg`  
description: Allows conditional startup of processes based on the `enable` parameter and the contents of this conditional config. If the value `enable` is a string, the process will start only if there is a line in the `conditional_config` file that has that exact content; otherwise, the process is skipped. For example, `enable="type=primary"` causes the `conditional_config` file to be examined for a line equal to `type=primary` when starting a process on the host. If there is no `type=primary` line in the file, the process is skipped.

parameter: `priority`  
required: No  
default value: `900`  
description: The priority of this waveform relative to the group of processes to start for this domain. Lower values will be started earlier. For example, priority 800 will be started before priority 900.

parameter: `autostart`  
required: No  
default value: `True`  
description: Specifies whether to automatically start this process when the AdminService starts, if `enable` is True.

parameter: `waitforprevious`  
required: No  
default value: `45`  
description: The number of seconds to wait for the previous higher priority process to start before trying to start this process.

parameter: `failafterwait`  
required: No  
default value: `False`  
description: Specifies whether to abort starting this domain if `waitforprevious` has expired and the previous process has not been declared started yet. This is useful to make sure the DeviceManager is started and all devices are ready before launching the waveform.

parameter: `started_status_script`  
required: No  
default value: None  
format: Absolute path of a file  
description: Specifies an optional script used to determine if the waveform started properly. A script exit value of `0` indicates the waveform started successfully.

parameter: `status_script`  
required: No  
default value: None  
format: Absolute path of a file  
description: Specifies an optional script to check the status for the waveform. A script exit value of `0` indicates the waveform is alive.

parameter: `query_script`  
required: No  
default value: None  
format: Absolute path of a file  
description: Specifies an optional script used to get a detailed status output for the waveform. This is useful to return a custom status string for the components in the waveform.

parameter: `environment`  
required: No  
default value: None  
format: A list of key/value pairs in the form `key="value",key2="value2"`  
description: Specifies whether to override existing environment variables or set new ones to be used when starting the waveform. This value does not get passed to the components running inside the waveform.

parameter: `user`  
required: No  
default value: `redhawk`  
description: Executes the process with User ID.

parameter: `group`

parameter: `logfile_directory`  
required: No  
default value: `/var/log/redhawk/waveforms`

parameter: `stdout_logfile`  
required: No  
default value: `<domain name>.<waveform name>.stdout.log`  
description: The name of a file that captures the stdout from the process. If not specified, the default value list above is used.

parameter: `stderr_logfile`  
required: No  
default value: `<domain name>.<waveform name>.stderr.log`  
description: If `redirect_stderr` is False, the name of a file that captures the stderr from the process. If not specified, the default value list above is used.

parameter: `redirect_stderr`  
required: No  
default value: `True`
