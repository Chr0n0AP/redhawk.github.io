For system integrators, REDHAWK provides an optional RPM, `redhawk-adminservice`, with the necessary scripts and configuration files to manage the REDHAWK core services: Domain Manager, Device Manager (includes devices and services), and waveforms. The RPM is part of the REDHAWK yum repository, but it is not installed by default.
