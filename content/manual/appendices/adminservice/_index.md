# AdminService

## Introduction

For system integrators, REDHAWK provides an optional RPM with the necessary scripts and configuration files to manage DomainManager, DeviceManager (includes devices and services), and Waveforms. The RPM, <br>`redhawk-adminservice-<version>.<os>.noarch.rpm`, is provided as part of the REDHAWK Runtime yum respository, but is not installed by default.

The REDHAWK AdminService is built on [Supervisor](<http://supervisord.org>) and uses an INI style configuration file (name=value) to define the command line arguments and execution environment for the service. The configuration files and service scripts provide enough flexibility to manage the REDHAWK core services for most use cases. For specialized cases, the REDHAWK source repository (`core-framework/adminservice`) provides an RPM spec file, `redhawk-adminservice.spec`, and all the source scripts for integrators to build and customize their own service scripts and installation RPM.

The following table describes the three main REDHAWK services and their configuration directories that contain the INI style configuration files.

##### REDHAWK AdminService Configuration Directories
| **Service**   | **Configuration Directory** |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- |
| AdminService  | /etc/redhawk                |
| Defaults      | /etc/redhawk/init.d         |
| DomainManager | /etc/redhawk/domains.d      |
| DeviceManager | /etc/redhawk/nodes.d        |
| Waveforms     | /etc/redhawk/waveforms.d    |

The AdminService is controlled by a single `adminserviced.conf` file residing in `/etc/redhawk`.  This configures both the AdminService and the rhadmin client. The default configurations for the DomainManagers, DeviceManagers and Waveforms are stored in the corresponding `.defaults` file in `/etc/redhawk/init.d`.

The DomainManager and DeviceManager configurations directly correspond to a process that runs on a system. On the other hand, the Waveform configurations tell the AdminService how to interact with the running REDHAWK Domain to start and stop Waveforms. The contents of the INI files for each specific service are explained in the following sections:

  - [DomainManagers]({{< relref "#domainmanagers" >}})

  - [DeviceManagers]({{< relref "#devicemanagers" >}})

  - [Waveforms]({{< relref "#waveforms" >}})

The following table describes the system service scripts provided by REDHAWK. REDHAWK supports both CentOS 6.x and 7.x system service frameworks.

### AdminService Configuration File

The AdminService configuration file follow a standard INI file format. This file is divided into five sections to configure the various aspects of the AdminService and rhadmin client. The defaults in the file should be sufficient for most cases. By default, the AdminService always uses the `/etc/redhawk/adminserviced.conf` configuration file. The [AdminService Configuration File]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/adminservice.md" >}}) section describes all the available configuration parameters for the AdminService.

To create a new AdminService configuration file and start the service, perform the following commands.  
{{% notice note %}}
 The configuration files reside in a system privileged directory. Ensure that you have proper privileges to create and edit files in those directories.
{{% /notice %}}


```
cd /etc/redhawk
rhadmin config admin > myadminserviced.cfg
vi myadminserviced.cfg
adminserviced -c /etc/redhawk/myadminserviced.cfg
```

##### REDHAWK AdminService Scripts
| **Service**            | **System Service Script**                              |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **CentOS 6 (SysV)**    |                                                        |
| AdminService           | `/etc/init.d/redhawk-adminservice`                     |
| **CentOS 7 (systemd)** |                                                        |
| AdminService           | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/redhawk-adminservice.service` |
| AdminService Wrapper   | `$OSSIEHOME/bin/adminserviced-start`                   |

The AdminService will group all configured services and Waveforms by domain and then start one domain at a time. By default, the start order, defined by the `priority` setting, is DomainManager, DeviceManager, and then Waveforms. An inverted order is used during system shutdown. As per the Fedora recommendations for service unit files, the AdminService is not enabled during RPM installation. It is assumed the system integrators will enable the  service unit file and modify the activation to achieve desired start up and shutdown behavior for their systems.

### rhadmin client
User interaction with the AdminService is through the rhadmin script. The rhadmin connects to the AdminService through a socket and issues commands to start, stop, status and shut down the REDHAWK Services and Waveforms.

The configuration of the rhadmin is through the `/etc/redhawk/adminserviced.conf` file. You can use the following command to use a different configuration file.
```
rhadmin -c /etc/redhawk/myadminserviced.conf
```

##### rhadmin Commands
| **Command** | **Argument**           | **Description**                                                                                                |

## DomainManagers

The REDHAWK DomainManagers are controlled by files in the `/etc/redhawk/domains.d` directory. The rhadmin can generate an example DomainManager configuration with the complete set of parameters that can be used to control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK DomainManager.

The [DomainManager Configuration File]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/domainmanager.md" >}}) section describes all the available configuration parameters for the DomainManager process.

### Configuration File

The configuration files follow a standard INI file format. This file can be divided into sections `[domain:domainname]` that can be used to define different instances of a DomainManager service. With this format, it is possible to define multiple DomainManager service instances. It is recommended that you define only one DomainManager service per configuration file. To create and start new DomainManager services, perform the following commands.  
{{% notice note %}}
 The configuration files reside in a system privileged directory. Ensure that you have proper privileges to create and edit files in those directories.
{{% /notice %}}


```
cd /etc/redhawk/domains.d
rhadmin config domain > mydom.cfg
vi mydom.cfg
sudo service redhawk-adminservice restart
```

## DeviceManagers
The REDHAWK DeviceManagers are controlled by files in the `/etc/redhawk/nodes.d` directory. The rhadmin can generate an example DeviceManager configuration with the complete set of parameters that can used to the control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK DeviceManager. There are no rules on partitioning nodes for a REDHAWK system. REDHAWKâ€™s only guidance is that you define one GPP per computing host.

The [DeviceManager Configuration File]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/devicemanager.md" >}}) section describes all the available configuration parameters for the DeviceManager process.

### Configuration File

The configuration files follow a standard INI file format. This file can be divided into sections `[node:nodename]` that can be used to define different DeviceManager instances. If you have multiple Nodes defined for a computing host, it is recommended that you have one configuration file per Node definition.

To create and start new DeviceManager services, perform the following commands.

{{% notice note %}}
 The configuration files reside in a system privileged directory. Ensure that you have proper privileges to create and edit files in those directories.
{{% /notice %}}


```
cd /etc/redhawk/nodes.d
rhadmin config node > redhawk_dev.gpp.node.cfg
vi redhawk_dev.gpp.node.cfg
sudo service redhawk-adminservice restart
```

## Waveforms

REDHAWK Waveforms are controlled by files in the `/etc/redhawk/waveforms.d` directory. The rhadmin can generate an example Waveform configuration with the complete set of parameters that can used to the control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK Waveform. The AdminService facilitates starting a Waveform at system startup for your REDHAWK system.

The [Waveform Configuration File]({{< relref "manual/appendices/adminservice/waveform.md" >}}) section describes all the available configuration parameters when launching a REDHAWK Waveform at system startup.

### Configuration File

The configuration files follow a standard INI file format. This file can be broken up into sections `[waveform:waveformname]` that can be used to define different Waveform instances.

To create and start a new Waveform, perform the following commands. The configuration files reside in a system privileged directory. Ensure that you have proper privileges to create and edit files in those directories.

```
cd /etc/redhawk/waveforms.d
rhadmin config waveform > redhawk_dev.controller.cfg
vi redhawk_dev.controller.cfg
sudo service redhawk-adminservice restart
```

## Linux Support Files

In addition to running REDHAWK services, the following support files are provided for REDHAWK logging properties, managing logging output files, system limit definitions, and kernel setup.
