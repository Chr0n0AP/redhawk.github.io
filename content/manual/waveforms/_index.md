This chapter discusses the construction and execution of waveforms within REDHAWK. An application is the software object that represents an instance of a waveform. A waveform is an XML file that describes the deployment, inter-connection, and configuration of components. It is possible to launch waveforms in the Sandbox as well as in the REDHAWK domain. This chapter discusses the mechanisms for launching a waveform as a running application in a domain.
