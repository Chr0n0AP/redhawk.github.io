The [Domain Manager]({{< relref "manual/runtime-environment/domain-manager.md" >}}) contains knowledge of all existing CORBA-enabled objects installed or loaded onto the system. This includes references to all file systems (through the filemanager), Device Managers, and all applications (and their Resources). The Domain Manager is seen as the central bookkeeper. The REDHAWK IDE can be used to run or connect to a running domain, view the contents of a running domain, and launch and interact with applications within the domain.
