If an error condition occurs within the Domain Manager which prevents a component, device, Domain Manager, or Device Manager from running correctly, the object’s representation in the REDHAWK Explorer is marked with a decorator in the lower left corner. Mouse hovering over the item’s icon provides a short description of the issue; however, if more than one problem has occurred, the hover text reads “Multiple Problems exist with this item”.
