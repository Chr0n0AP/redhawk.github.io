![The REDHAWK Explorer View](../../images/REDHAWK_Explorer_View.png)

The REDHAWK Explorer View enables users to navigate the contents of a REDHAWK domain. It provides capabilities for [viewing the contents of the domain]({{< relref "manual/exploring-domain/_index.md" >}}), configuring instantiated resources, and launching applications in a target SDR. It also provides access to the [IDE Sandbox]({{< relref "manual/sandbox/ide/_index.md" >}}), which is an environment for running components and applications without launching a Domain Manager or Device Manager.
