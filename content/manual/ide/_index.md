The REDHAWK IDE is a tool that enables developers to create, test, and deploy software for REDHAWK systems. This tool is built on Eclipse, which is a generic, extensible IDE that allows developers to add custom modules. The REDHAWK IDE, therefore, leverages all of the features available in a bare-bones Eclipse IDE while also providing customized features specific to REDHAWK development.

The following features are included in the REDHAWK IDE:

  - Eclipse - <http://eclipse.org/>
  - Eclipse JDT - Java Development Tooling for Eclipse: <http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/>
  - Eclipse CDT - C++ Development Tooling for Eclipse. Includes tools for autoconf, rpm spec file editing, and many debugging tools: <http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/>
  - Eclipse CORBA - IDL Editor for Eclipse: <http://eclipsecorba.sourceforge.net/>
  - PyDev - Python Development Tooling for Eclipse: <http://pydev.org/>
  - Eclipse Git - Git Tooling for Eclipse: <https://www.eclipse.org/egit/>

For signal processing developers, the REDHAWK IDE provides graphical interfaces for the auto-generation of component, device, and service code in C++, Python, and Java. Built on top of the Eclipse JDT, Eclipse PyDev, and Eclipse CDT, the IDE provides feature-rich editors for code written in any of the three languages. In addition, a drag-and-drop environment for testing these modules and constructing them into waveforms and nodes is available.

For system developers, the IDE provides an environment for deploying and maintaining applications onto fielded systems. Furthermore, the pluggable nature of Eclipse allows system developers to add customized system user-interface modules.

The REDHAWK Explorer is a lighter-weight application that includes a subset of the REDHAWK IDEâ€™s functionality. The REDHAWK Explorer can be used to connect to a running REDHAWK domain, navigate the contents, launch and view waveforms, and so forth. It provides no development functionality, only runtime interaction with REDHAWK domains.
