title: "Using Devices to Interface with FPGAs"

Many SDR systems depend on custom hardware solutions implemented on FPGAs and GPUs. REDHAWK has developed a design pattern to interface with these custom hardware solutions that enables users and the REDHAWK Framework alike to change the behavior of an FPGA at run-time to meet the needs of the application. Refer to [REDHAWK Persona Device Pattern]({{< relref "manual/appendices/persona-device-pattern.md" >}}) for more information.
