| **Function/Data Structure**   | **Description** |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `setNumChannels`              | Used to size various `FrontendTunerDevice` class data structures. |
| `frontend_tuner_status`       | This is the FrontEnd tuner status property, which is a vector of structs. The indices match the `tuner_id` or index of the tuner used by the FrontEnd Tuner device. The developer is responsible for maintaining all fields with the sole exception of the `allocation_id_csv`, which is managed internally by the `FrontendTunerDevice` class. |
| `getControlAllocationId`      | Returns the control Allocation ID for the tuner specified, or an empty string if not allocated. |
| `getTunerMapping`             | Returns the tuner ID or tuner index of the tuner associated with the Allocation ID,  or -1 if the Allocation ID is not associated with any tuner. |
| `create`                      | Returns a `StreamSRI` object constructed using the `frontend_tuner_status` for a tuner, including the required SRI keywords. Only required FrontEnd tuner status fields are used in constructing the `StreamSRI`, and any additional information that affects `StreamSRI` must be manually modified. In the case of DDC tuners, there is an optional parameter accepted by create for specifying the collector frequency since this information cannot be gathered from the `frontend_tuner_status struct`. |
| `printSRI`                    | Used for debug purposes to print the values of a `StreamSRI` object to stdout.|
| `addModifyKeyword`            | Used to add a keyword to a `StreamSRI` object, or modify an existing keyword. |
| `uuidGenerator`               | Used to generate a new uuid string.|
| `floatingPointCompare`        | Used to handle potential errors introduced by floating-point math. Default precision is to the tenths place, and there is an optional parameter that can be used to specify a different precision. |
| `matchAllocationIdToStreamId` | Only available when multi-out ports are specified. Multi-out capability of a BulkIO port only pushes stream data with a particular Stream ID to connections that have a connection ID that matches the Allocation id. It is recommended that this function be called in `deviceSetTuning`.|
| `validateRequest`             | Used to verify that a value falls within the specified range. This function is overloaded to accept a range as well, to verify that it falls within a second range.  |
| `validateRequestVsSRI`        | Used to check that the input data stream can support the allocation request. The output mode (`True` if complex output) is used when determining the necessary sample rate required to satisfy the request. The entire frequency band of the request must be available for `True` to be returned, not just the center frequency. `True` is returned upon success, otherwise `FRONTEND::BadParameterException` is thrown. If the `CHAN_RF` and `FRONTEND::BANDWIDTH` keywords are not found in the SRI, `FRONTEND::BadParameterException` is thrown. |
| `validateRequestVsRFInfo`     | Used to check that the analog capabilities can support the allocation request. The mode (`True` if complex) is used when determining the necessary sample rate required to satisfy the request. The entire frequency band of the request must be available for `True` to be returned, not just the center frequency. `True` is returned upon success, otherwise `FRONTEND::BadParameterException` is thrown. |
| `validateRequestVsDevice`     | Used to check that the input data stream and the device can support an allocation request. The mode (`True` if complex output) is used when determining the necessary sample rate required to satisfy the request. The entire frequency band of the request must be available for `True` to be returned, not just the center frequency. `True` is returned upon success, otherwise `FRONTEND::BadParameterException` is thrown. This function is overloaded to accept `RFInfoPkt` for an analog input data stream, and `StreamSRI` for a digital input data stream. For `StreamSRI`, if the `CHAN_RF` and `FRONTEND::BANDWIDTH` keywords are not found in the SRI, `FRONTEND::BadParameterException` is thrown. |
