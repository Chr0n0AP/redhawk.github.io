To run a component, use one of the following mechanisms: the REDHAWK Sandbox or the REDHAWK domain. When using the Sandbox, a component is run from within a Python shell or a graphical environment, all operating on a single computer. When using the domain, a component is run in the context of an application that can be deployed over an arbitrarily large number of computers. The Sandbox is useful for tasks such as signal processing development and analysis, component debugging, and data inspection.
