Shared libraries are a way to share common code between multiple REDHAWK projects, both at development and run time. When developing components or devices, REDHAWK shared libraries are automatically integrated into the build system. At run time, a componentâ€™s dependencies are copied to the GPP as required, eliminating the need to install dependencies on each system in a domain.

Using shared libraries reduces the development, maintenance, and deployment costs of REDHAWK systems.
